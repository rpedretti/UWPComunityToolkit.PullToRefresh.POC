# UWPComunityToolkit.PullToRefresh.POC
POC to demostrate RefreshIndicatorContent behavior

## Expected behavior
After releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top (as a simple list do) and While awaitng for 
the data to be fetched the Refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control its visible (i would prefer this)
or position

## Effective result
After releasing the pointer or finger the list abruptly return to position 0 and the refresh indicator is hidden
